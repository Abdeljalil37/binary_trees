# Binary Tree Implementation in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of a binary tree in the C programming language. Binary trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Features

- Basic operations on a binary tree:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Searching
  - Traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have a C compiler installed. This implementation is designed to work with standard C libraries.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-tree-c.git
   cd binary-tree-c
   ```

2. Compile the source code:

   ```bash
   gcc binary_tree.c -o binary_tree
   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./binary_tree
   ```

## Usage

The `binary_tree.c` file contains the implementation of the binary tree. You can include this file in your C project or use it as a standalone program. Modify the `main` function in `binary_tree.c` to test the functionality or integrate it into your application.

```c
// Example usage in main function
#include <stdio.h>
#include "binary_tree.c"

int main() {
    struct Node *root = NULL;

    // Insert nodes
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    // Print in-order traversal
    printf("In-order traversal: ");
    inOrderTraversal(root);

    // Example of other operations...
    
    return 0;
}
```
